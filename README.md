# Discord Cloud Storage
Abusing Discord's servers for unlimited cloud storage!
## So, what is this?
Infamous 8MB limit for non-nitro users can get pretty annoying if you have a long video to share.<br/>
This thing can chunk any of your files and upload them directly to discord, one by one piece, each being worth 8MB.<br/>
When you need your file, it downloads all chunks and joins them together.
## Try it out!
Due to Heroku free tier going down, I do not currently have a demo running :(<br>
Suggest platforms for hosting in issues!
## How to run
* create a `key.txt` file in your project directory with your Discord bot auth token
* Open project
* Run `npm run build`
