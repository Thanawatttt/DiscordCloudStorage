# Discord Cloud Storage
Abusing Discord's servers for unlimited cloud storage!
## So, what is this?
Infamous 8MB limit for non-nitro users can get pretty annoying if you have a long video to share.<br/>
This thing can chunk any of your files and upload them directly to discord, one by one piece, each being worth 8MB.<br/>
When you need your file, it downloads all chunks and joins them together.
## Try it out!

Feel free to upload very large files entirely on discord!
## IMPORTANT: Not done yet D:
I swear, I just gotta finish my frontend and that's it!
